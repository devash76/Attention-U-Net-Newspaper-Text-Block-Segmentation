# Text-Block-Segmentation
Segmenting text blocks from newspaper images using deep learning techinques

<ul>
  <li> Introduction </li>
  Tensorflow code for the paper Multi-task Learning for Newspaper Image Segmentation and Baseline Detection Using Attention-Based U-Net Architecture. This repo contains the code to the multi task attention U-Net that we used for basline segmentation and textblock segmentation. The apart from the model, main.ipynb file contains the code for pre-processing,
  visualising attention maps and testing.
